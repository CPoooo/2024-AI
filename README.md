# 2048 Game

Welcome to the 2048 game project! This is a personal project created by me, Cameron Pool, to practice coding fundamentals and explore game development. The project serves as an enjoyable way to apply programming skills and understand the intricacies of game mechanics and AI implementation.

## About

This project implements the popular 2048 game, where players combine tiles to reach the 2048 tile. The game is built using Pygame, and it includes features such as score tracking and a "New Game" button. 

The primary goals of this project are:
- To practice and reinforce coding fundamentals.
- To gain hands-on experience with game development.
- To learn how to create and integrate an AI agent into a game.

## Features

- Play the classic 2048 game with a graphical interface.
- Score tracking and display.
- "New Game" button to start over.
- Basic AI implementation to enhance gameplay (planned for future updates).

## Collaboration

Collaborations are welcome! If you have ideas for improvements, new features, or any other contributions, feel free to reach out. This project is a work in progress, and feedback or collaboration is highly encouraged.

## Getting Started

To run the game locally, ensure you have Python and Pygame installed. Clone this repository and execute the `main.py` file.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CPoooo/2048-AI.git
cd 2048-game
python main.py
```
